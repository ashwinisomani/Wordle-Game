# Wordle-Game

Wordle is a word-guessing game that involves trying to guess a five-letter word in six guesses.

To play Wordle, the player enters a five-letter word guess into a text box and the game responds by highlighting each letter in one of three colors: green, yellow, or gray. A green letter indicates that the letter is in the correct position in the word, a yellow letter indicates that the letter is in the word but in a different position, and a gray letter indicates that the letter is not in the word at all.
The player uses this feedback to make subsequent guesses until the correct word is guessed or all six guesses are used up.
